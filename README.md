# ML Courses
Here you will find all the Homework assignments I gave as teach assistant to my students along the years of teaching

## Winter 2024
### Homework 1:
- Understanding linear regression and the impact of scaling
- Classifying wine data into categories using Gaussian Bayes vs Naive Bayes
- Naive bayes classifying arcticles into classes.
- KNN Implementation and comparision to different metric with stars dataset.

### Homework 2:
- Implement Logistic regression (using GD) with understanding scaling.
- Nonlinear SVM - construct a kernel with specific shape to separate data vs other deafult kernels.
- Implement Perceptron.
- Analyzing the consine kernel and solve a toy problem by hand (no code).

### Homework 3:
- Implement (partially) decision tree with continious features and compare between different impurity types.
- Implement (partially) random forest and choose between different estimators and impurity types (model selection)
- Implement kernel regression on synthetic dataset (sinusoidal data) and using cross validation.
- Theory of PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) and VC dimension understanding

### Homework 4:
- Implement (partially) Kmeans class and use it to quantize image.
- Adaboost toy dataset classification.
- Implement PCA on smiling-face dataset using KNN for classification
- ~~Implement NN with one fc layer and softmax (including backpropagation).~~ Depreacted due to war of 7/10.

### Final work:
- LDA, MLE, Bayesian risk and NN computation questions.
- Understanding Decision trees and working with new "Perceptron tree" model.
- Logistic regression deeper understanding.
- PAC learning deeper understanding.

## Spring 2023
### Homework 1:
- Bayesian Decision rule (generic risk) computation on real life problem.
- Probability and MLE
- Naive bayes classifying arcticles into classes.

### Homework 2:
- Parzen window computation and proof questions.
- PCA on Fashion-MNIST dataset using KNN for classification, both hand implemented.
- Implement Logistic regression (using GD).
- Comparison between different SVM kerenels according to data.
- Analyzing the consine kernel and solve a toy problem by hand (no code).

### Homework 3:
- Theory of PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) and VC dimension understanding.
- Implement (partially) decision tree with max depth limitation and comparing different depths (model selection).
- Implement (partially) random forest and make model selection again.
- Implement (partially) Kmeans class and use it to quantize image and theory question.
- Adaboost toy dataset classification.
