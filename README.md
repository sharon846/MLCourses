# ML Courses
Here you will find all the Homework assignments I gave as teach assistant to my students along the years of teaching

## Winter 2024
### Homework 1:
- Understanding linear regression and the impact of scaling
- Classifying wine data into categories using Gaussian Bayes vs Naive Bayes
- Naive bayes classifying arcticles into classes.
- KNN Implementation and comparision to different metric with stars dataset.

### Homework 2:
- Implement Logistic regression (using GD) with understanding scaling.
- Nonlinear SVM - construct a kernel with specific shape to separate data vs other deafult kernels.
- Implement Perceptron.
- Analyzing the consine kernel and solve a toy problem by hand (no code).

### Homework 3:
- Implement (partially) decision tree with continious features and compare between different impurity types.
- Implement (partially) random forest.
- Implement kernel regression on synthetic dataset (sinusoidal data) and using cross validation.
- Theory of PAC (Probably Approximately Correct)
